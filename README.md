# Idea of Memory game (programming way)

We will have a context with a useState (React hook). Called "game_state"

This game state will have 4 values

### `welcome, game, game_over, congrats`

These states will determine which page will be shown, 

## Welcome

This will just have a welcome message and a button to start the game

## Game

Just the game, not much to say.

## Game over

We'll show this page when user loses, a user loses when after 20 tries doesn't matches all of the cards


## Congrats

We'll show this page when user wins.


# First brain storm 

[in FreeForm](https://www.icloud.com/freeform/0c9Q3eApqIdO_3khbpTj4-a7w#Memory_main_and_first_idea)

We'll use styled-components to style this app
